\section{Discussion}
\label{sec.limitation}

One of our challenges in conducting this study was deciding where to place the
limits of its scope. The literature documents a variety of strategies that, over
the years, have been used to secure the OS kernel. To explore any one strategy
in depth, we felt it was necessary to intentionally exclude consideration of
other valid approaches. In this section, we acknowledge some of the alternative
approaches that we chose not to investigate, as well as a few issues that we plan
to address in the future.

\textbf{Exclusions.}
In designing our study, we intentionally decided that we would not include any
discussion of native or “bare-metal” hypervisors that run directly on server
hardware. Though these devices, also called Type I hypervisors, have been used
for decades, we chose to exclude them because our initial emphasis in designing
Lind was to come up with something small and light that did not require any
alterations to the kernel. As we continue to develop our Lind prototype, we may
choose to study current examples of these native hypervisors to either directly
compare security and performance attributes, or to see if our design metric could
be adapted to these machines.

A second exclusion stems from our criteria for locating bugs. At the beginning
of our study, we identified a set of common but seriously dangerous zero day bugs
and then went looking for them within our obtained kernel traces. By looking only
for a specific subset of bugs, we acknowledged that we might be limiting our
ability to find a broader spectrum of kernel vulnerabilities. For example, bugs
caused by a race condition, or that involve defects in the internal kernel data
structures, or that require complex triggering conditions across multiple kernel
paths, may not be immediately found using our metric. As we continue to refine
our metric, we will look to also evolve our evaluation
criteria to allow us to find and protect against more complex brands of bugs.
In the meantime, we feel that avoiding the triggering of this initial set of bugs
through the use of our "Lock-in-Pop" design scheme can still address the security
needs for a significant segment of users.

\textbf{Future work.}
While our experiments were limited to the Linux kernel 3.14.1, our future work
will include testing its applicability to other operating systems, such as
Windows and Mac OS. Since the Lock-in-Pop design scheme is not dependent on the use of any
specific hardware, we believe it has the flexibility to be adapted to these other
widely-used systems.

The other challenge facing wide-scale adoption of Lind is improving its
performance in terms of bandwidth and other overhead factors. As addressed in
Section 6.4, Lind does incur some performance overhead. Since our initial tests
were focused on security issues, we did not take any steps to optimize
its performance before running these tests. Future work will focus on identifying
the factors that contribute to this overhead, and the best ways to make Lock-in-Pop
a cost-effective alternative to other virtual machine designs.
