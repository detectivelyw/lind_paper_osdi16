\subsection*{Abstract}
A possible compromise of privileged code, such as that in the OS kernel, is a
daunting security threat. Severe vulnerabilities have been discovered in this
code, which, when triggered, have resulted in privilege escalation,
denial of service [CVE-2015-8539], [CVE-2015-5364], memory corruption
 [CVE-2014-9529] and other problems. However, securing this code has been hampered
  by a lack of knowledge about where flaws may be located. In this paper, we
 document the development and testing of a new secure virtual
 machine based on a quantitative evaluation metric that predicts code located
  in the popular paths will contain fewer bugs. We leverage this knowledge
  for a design scheme called  Lock-in-Pop, which locks out application access
 to all kernel code except that found in paths associated with frequently-used
 popular programs. Lastly, we build and test a secure virtual machine called Lind,
  which accesses only the popular code paths through a very small trusted computing
   base. Complex functionalities in Lind are addressed by using a memory-safe
    programming language to re-create riskier system calls within a sandbox.
  When Lind was tested against seven other virtual machines in whether it would
   trigger any of 35 bugs examined in Linux kernel version 3.14.1, the threat of
    an attack was reduced to less than 3\%. This result is about an order of
    magnitude better than existing systems like VirtualBox (40\%), VMWare Workstation
     (31\%), Docker (23\%), LXC (34\%), QEMU (14\%), KVM (14\%), and Graphene (23\%).
