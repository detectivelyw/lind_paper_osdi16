\subsection*{Abstract}
A possible compromise of privileged code, such as that in the OS kernel, is a
daunting security threat. Severe vulnerabilities discovered in this code
have resulted in privilege escalation, denial of service, memory corruption and
other complications. Virtual machines have been developed to protect kernel code
through isolation. Yet, bugs have been exploited in a number of VMs, indicating
that isolation alone is not sufficient protection. In this paper, we
document the development of a different type of virtual
machine to secure the OS kernel. We begin by proposing and testing a new
quantitative evaluation metric that affirms code located
in popular paths will contain fewer bugs. We leverage this knowledge
for a design called Lock-in-Pop, which locks out application access
to all kernel code except that found in paths associated with frequently-used
popular programs. Lastly, we use Lock-in-Pop as a blueprint for building a secure
virtual machine called Lind, which accesses only the popular code paths through
a very small trusted computing base. Complex functionalities in Lind are performed
within a sandbox, using a memory-safe programming language to re-create riskier system calls.
  When Lind was tested against seven other virtual machines to see whether it would
   trigger any of 35 bugs examined in Linux kernel version 3.14.1, the threat of
    an attack was reduced to less than 3\%. This result is about an order of
    magnitude better than existing systems like VirtualBox (40\%), VMWare Workstation
     (31\%), Docker (23\%), LXC (34\%), QEMU (14\%), KVM (14\%), and Graphene (23\%).
