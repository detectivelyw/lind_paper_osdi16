\section{Related Work}
\label{sec.related_work}

This section summarizes a number of previous approaches to ensuring the safety of
 privileged code. %in user space and kernel space.
The literature referenced in this section includes past efforts to better define safety metrics,
and to quantify areas of risk in an OS kernel, key studies in the use of various virtualization
techniques, as well as background information on technologies incorporated into Lind.

\textbf{Safety metrics for evaluating software risk.}
As we discussed in Section~\ref{sec.metric}, one safety metric
approach looked at identifying a correlation between
certain directories or module of the system and the presence of bugs (Chou~\cite{PittSFIeld},
Palix~\cite{palix2011faults}.)
However, this component-focused approach does not necessarily
provide effective detection and defense against kernel bugs, as our test of the
Chou metric in Section~\ref{sec.metric} attests.

There are other approaches to identifying kernel vulnerabilities, some of
which grew out of research in complexity and code comprehension.
Alhazmi~\cite{alhazmi2008application}
used metrics like defect density and fault exposure ratio to describe the
vulnerability discovery process. Zimmermann~\cite{zimmermann2010searching}
described metrics like code complexity, and code churn (the total added/modified/
deleted lines of code) to predict vulnerabilities. Kim in~\cite{kim2007vulnerability} analyzed
the correlation between shared code size and shared vulnerabilities in
successive versions of a software system. In~\cite{engler2001bugs} Engler analyzed
system code by static analysis to look for contradictions, such as acquired locks that are
not released. While
these prior approaches can be useful for determining readiness for release, and
evaluating the risk of vulnerability exploitation,
they do not provide insights for secure system design.

Lastly, prior work has also examined the evolution of kernel defects over time, including
Ozment~\cite{ozment2006milk} (see Section~\ref{sec.metric} and Li~\cite{li2006have}.
Li found a decrease in memory-related
bugs, and identified semantic bugs as being the dominant root cause of these
defects.
% \lois{this sentence about Li says nothing and reads like
% nonsense. He reported an increase in the bugs by studying the number of bugs?

However, unlike Lind, neither of these approaches provide data
on how vulnerabilities are distributed.

%Much work has been done in analyzing system faults using techniques in
%software engineering. For example,

\lois{I stopped working on this because I see a fundamental problem. A related work
generally mentions the author, as we have done above. What follows starting from this
part of the section reads like the component descriptions that used to be in the paper.
We need to talk about this}

\textbf{Design of virtualization systems.}
Lind incorporates a number of previous virtualization techniques, such as Library OSes.
This section details some
of the significant work relevant to the development of today's virtual machines,
including Lind.

\textit{System Call Interposition} (SCI) is a technique tried by many researchers 
to develop early virtualization systems. 
Goldberg, et al. developed Janus \cite{Janus0:96, Janus:99}, a filtering-based SCI system. 
The key idea is to adopt a user-level ``monitor'' that filter system call requests, based on 
a user-specified policy. Later on, Garfinkel, et al. proposed a delegating architecture for secure system call interposition, 
called Ostia \cite{SCI-04}. Their system introduced emulation libraries in the user space 
to mediate sensitive system calls issued by the sandboxed process. 
Researchers have realized that many limitations come with SCI. 
Garfinkel has examined and discussed many important issues and problems \cite{Problems-SCI} related to SCI systems.
SCI is similar to the Lind isolation mechanism. However, a key difference is the actual execution
of a system call through Lind's SafePOSIX re-creation to ensure safe POSIX API for the userspace applications. 
In SCI systems, there is no such re-creation module. 

\textit{Software Fault Isolation} (SFI) is another widely-used technique 
to build virtual machines. 
Wahbe, et al. \cite{SFI:93} presented a software approach to implementing 
fault isolation within a single address space. 
Yee, et al. from Google developed Native Client (NaCl) \cite{NaCl-09}, 
an SFI system for the Chrome browser that allows native executable code to run directly in a
browser. NaCl prevents suspicious code
from memory corruption or direct access to the underlying system
resources. Lind adopts NaCl as one key component to ensure secure execution
of binary code.

\textit{Language-based virtualization.}
Programming languages like Java, JavaScript, Lua~\cite{Lua}, and
Silverlight~\cite{Silverlight} can provide safety in virtual systems by
``translating" application commands into a native language.
%
Though many sandboxes implement the bulk of standard libraries in
memory-safe languages like Java or C\#, flaws in this code can
still pose a threat~\cite{JavaBugs, Java-Lessons}.
Any bug or failure in a programming language virtual
machine is usually fatal. In contrast, the main component of Lind
is built using Repy, which is a programming language with a very small TCB.
This enhances the security of privileged code due to fewer LOC in the popular kernel paths, 
which in turn reduces the number of potential bugs or weaknesses.

\textit{OS virtualization}
techniques include
bare-metal hardware virtualization, such as VMware ESX Server, Xen,
LXC~\cite{LXC}, BSD's jail, Solaris zones, and Hyper-V, and
hosted hypervisor virtualization such as VMware
Workstation, VMware Server, VirtualPC and VirtualBox.
Security by isolation \cite{Qubes, Overshadow, SecureVM, HypSec}
provides safe executing environments through containment for multiple
user-level virtual environments sharing the same hardware.
However, there are limitations of this approach due to
the large attack vectors against the hypervisors, including
vulnerabilities of software and configuration risks. Lind avoids such restrictions due to a smaller TCB.

\textit{Library OSes}
allow applications to efficiently obtain the benefits of virtual machines
by refactoring a traditional OS kernel into an application library. 
Porter, et al. developed Drawbridge \cite{Drawbridge-11}, 
a library OS that uses picoprocesses (lightweight containers), 
a security monitor (to enforce rules),
and a library OS to present a Windows persona for %a wide variety of
Windows applications. Similar to Lind,
it restricts access from usermode to host OS through a number
of operations that pass through the security monitor.
%\lois{How does this fit with Lind?}
%
%This approach brings many of the benefits of VM based temporal,
%spatial and fault isolation properties to a per-process level.
%
Baumann, et al. presented Bascule \cite{Bascule}, an architecture for library OS extensions
based on Drawbridge, allows application behavior to be customized by
extensions loaded at runtime. Later on, they further extended their work and developed Haven \cite{Haven},
which uses a library OS to implement
shielded execution of unmodified server applications
in an untrusted cloud host.
Tsai, et al. developed Graphene \cite{Graphene-14}, a library OS system that
executes both single and
multi-process applications with low performance overheads.

While library OSes rely extensively on
the underlying kernels to perform system functions,
Lind re-creates complex OS functions through memory-safe Repy
code, relying on only a limited set of system functions from the Repy
sandbox. Unlike Lind, Drawbridge, Bascule or Haven
do not have the sandbox environment that properly contains
buggy or malicious behavior, and therefore could allow attackers
to trigger zero-day vulnerabilities in the underlying kernel.
