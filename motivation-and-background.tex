\section{Goals and Threat Model}
\label{sec.motivation-and-background}

\textbf{Goals.}
Our goal is to design and build secure virtualization systems that allow
untrusted programs to run on an unpatched and vulnerable host OS (Linux OS in 
this study), without triggering vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. 
Developing effective defenses for the host OS kernel is essential as this privileged code 
can provide attackers access that could lead to a system take-over.

To combat this threat, untrusted programs are often executed in a secure 
virtualization system, such as a guest OS virtual machine, a system call interposition 
module, or a library OS system. Our intent is to
build such a secure virtualization system capable of protecting not only
an underlying host OS, but also any programs running in it, from both malicious attacks
and accidental bugs by applications. However, as we will document
in Section 4, we are not the first to propose such a system.
In this section, we define the scope of our approach, including some basic
assumptions about the level of security that we intend to enforce,
and the possible attacks that we desire to protect against. We also briefly note
a few existing design schemes we chose to exclude from this study and why.

In our study, we acknowledge that an attack attempt on the host OS could be staged in our secure
virtualization system. The security goal is to prevent a potential outcome of such
an attack: the exploitation of an unpatched vulnerability. Furthermore, we
anticipate that such an exploit could be done directly, by performing an action in the
virtualization system, or indirectly by causing a vulnerability to escape the
containment of the virtualization system. In the former case, the attacker is
taking advantage of the secure system by utilizing paths in the host OS kernel
that have a vulnerability. In the second case, once the attacker has exploited
this type of flaw, the attack program will be able to run arbitrary code, and
therefore can make any system call in the host OS directly. 
The secure virtualization system we will propose
in Section 4 is designed to prevent both types of attacks.

\noindent
\textbf{Threat model.}
To summarize, our threat model makes the following assumptions.

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}

\item The attacker possesses the knowledge about one or more unpatched vulnerabilities in the host OS.

\item The attacker is permitted to execute any code in the secure virtualization system.

\item If the attack program can trigger a vulnerability in any privileged code,
whether in the host OS or the secure virtualization system, the attacker is then considered successful 
in compromising the system.

\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Exclusion.}
It should be noted that we intentionally excluded from our study several existing
solutions for building a virtualization system. These techniques were considered
out of scope, as they have different hardware and software requirements.
Primarily we chose not to include solutions that do not run on top of on a full-fledged
privileged operating system, such as a virtualization system that uses a
bare-metal hypervisor~\cite{Xen-03} or hardware-based virtualization
solution~\cite{IntelVT}. 
These solutions have substantial dependency on the
underlying hardware, which differs from our proposed model. In addition,
they do not interact with a privileged OS kernel, which makes them different
in structure and function. 

To achieve our goals, we need to have a better understanding about how
bugs are triggered by attack programs. It is therefore critical to know where
vulnerabilities are located in an OS kernel. Our first step is to design
a security metric that can quantitatively measure how bugs and vulnerabilities
are distributed in the kernel.
